/*

  EngineWrapper: A wrapper for the chess engine context and threading.
  It provides a bridge between the main application and the chess engine (in this case, Sockfish).
  This way, Sockfish is completely isolated from the rest of the application. Being a standalone package on its own.

  So, 'Engine' and 'Sockfish' are two different concepts.
  'Engine' is a constant bridge module in this application, which connects 'Sockfish' into the project.
  And, 'Sockfish' is a standalone chess engine module. Regards search algorithms, depth and so on...
